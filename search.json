    "text": "WarningWork in Progress\n\n\n\nI am actively updating this post. Content may change frequently as work my way through this article.\n\n\n\ntl;dr\nThings are bad, but not as bad as you might think.\nNationally,\n\nFrom January 1963 to January 2026, the price-to-income ratio of a home has increased by 0.04 per year on average. As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 4.521, placing it in the 70th percentile of all observations in this period.\nFrom April 19712 to January 2026, the mortgage debt-to-income ratio has decreased by -0.001 per year on average. As of January 2026, the ratio stands at 0.273, placing it in the 47th percentile of all observations in this period.\n\n1 Meaning the typical house costs the typical household 4.52 \\(\\times\\) their gross annual income2 Freddie Mac began surveying lenders on mortgage rates in April 1971, making this the earliest date for which consistent, nationwide data is available.3 Meaning the typical household would spend 0.27 \\(\\times\\) their monthly income on their mortgage. this calculation assumes only interest and principal.\n\nintro\nMuch has been written recently on housing affordability, with much of it being negative4. Aside from the tendency of news organizations to produce negative content, I think what is lost in these reports is historical context: where were we, and where are we now? Even when the historical context is present, metrics may be used that, if not interpreted carefully, can be misleading.\n4 Here’s a few: CBS, NBC, and FOXFor instance, longtermtrends.com gives a chart that shows the ratio of the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index to the median household income. The problem here is that the Case-Shiller index is a weighted average; the distribution of home values tend to be right skewed, so an average will be greater than the median (the typical house). This results in a price-to-income ratio that is a bit more pessimistic. The typical person is buying the typical house, not the average house.\nIn order to provide some clarity on the questions of housing affordability, I’m going to look at two metrics:\n\nThe ratio of the typical cost of a house to the typical household income.\nThe proportion of a person’s monthly income that would be dedicated to their monthly mortgage.\n\nI’m planning to examine this at three different geographic scales:\n\nNational\nState\nCounty\n\n\n\nnational\nThe data we are using from the FRED:\n\nCPIAUCSL: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average\nMSPUS: Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States\nMORTGAGE30US: 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States\nMEHOINUSA646N: Median Household Income in the United States\n\nA first look at the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I need to do:\n\nPut the data in the same time frequency (use time series models)\n\nCPIAUCSL: monthly\nMEHOINUSA646N: annual\nMORTGAGE30US: weekly\nMSPUS: quarterly\n\nForecast some series to match the most recent data point available.

Converted to a monthly frequency.5 Range examined from the max-min date (January, 1963) of the different series to the max date (January, 2026) of all the series.\n5 Weekly frequency has been averaged. Annual and quarterly frequency linearly interpolated.

However, they use the Case-Shiller index which gives the average home price and divide that by the median. This gives a more pessimistic view of the cost of housing than is actual."
