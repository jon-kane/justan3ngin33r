In an attempt to organize that noise, and to help me remember things, I’ve started this website to share things that I find interesting.\nMost musings will probably have a data science flavor, though I make no promises. This website is powered by coffee, so if you find any of this helpful and would like to support my work, consider buying me a coffee.\nThe animation on this page is of the collatz conjecture and was inspired by this visual."

Content may change frequently as work my way through this article.\n\n\nI want to look at…\n\nThe proportion of a person’s monthly income that would be dedicated to their monthly mortgage (30-year).\nThe (total cost of a house)/(annual income)\n\nI want to examine this info over time and look at it from a…\n\nNational level\nState level\nCounty level\n\n\nnationally\nThe data we are using from the FRED:\n\nCPIAUCSL: Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average\nMSPUS: Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States\nMORTGAGE30US: 30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States\nMEHOINUSA646N: Median Household Income in the United States\n\nA first look at the data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I need to do:\n\nPut the data in the same time frequency (use time series models)\n\nCPIAUCSL: monthly\nMEHOINUSA646N: annual\nMORTGAGE30US: weekly\nMSPUS: quarterly\n\nForecast some series to match the most recent data point available.

However, they use the Case-Shiller index which gives the average home price and divide that by the median. This gives a more pessimistic view of the cost of housing than is actual."
