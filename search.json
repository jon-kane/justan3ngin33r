In an attempt to organize that noise, and to help me remember things, I’ve started this website to share things that I find interesting.\nMost musings will probably have a data science flavor, though I make no promises. This website is powered by coffee, so if you find any of this helpful and would like to support my work, consider buying me a coffee.\nThe animation on this page is of the collatz conjecture and was inspired by this visual."
